               <p>Leonardo DiCaprio currently sits at the board of important environmental organizations, 
                like the World Wildlife Fund, NDRC, Global Green USA and the International Fund 
                for Animal Welfare. In addition to this, the actor has produced two short movies 
                (Water Planet and Global Warming) to raise awareness on environmental topics.
                 DiCaprio also used his production company, Appian Way, to write, narrate and 
                 produce his critically acclaimed documentary: The 11th hour. The film was four
                 years in the making and provides the public with an overview of Earthâ€™s problems, 
                as well as exciting solutions for them. So is the present inspirational person.Now in general terms lets talk about they to save the environment....
               </p>

               <h3> Why should we save environment : </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>1. Global warming is a serious environmental issue. The continuous emission of carbon dioxide by thermal power generating units is the leading cause for the surge in  greenhouse gases.

               2. Natural resources are limited. If the natural resources such as oil, coal, etc. are used, one day the world may fall short of these resources.

               3. High-level of environmental pollution is detrimental for human and animal health.

               4. Forests are fast depleting. It may cause soil erosion and drought situation.

               5. Excessive use of pesticides and contamination of soil have negatively affected soil output. These fruits and vegetables are not very healthy for human health. </p>  

               <p></p>   

               <h3>How to save environment :   </h3>

               <p></p>
               <p>1. We should save drinking water. Water is a precious component of our environment. It should never be wasted.

                  2. We should never pollute water. Efforts should be made in making significant reduction in both domestic and industrial disposal in water bodies.

                  3. As far as practicable, the waste products should be recycled to make new items. The domestic and industrial garbage should be segregated as recyclable and non-recyclable before being dumped.

                  4. There should be a zero tolerance policy towards deforestation. Each one of us can contribute towards saving the environment by planting just one tree every-month.

                  5. We can make donations to NGOs that are engaged in planting trees, or in any-way working towards saving the environment.

                  6. Safer environmental friendly car and vehicles should be used. For short distances, people should be encouraged to use bicycle in place of motor based vehicles.

                  7. The use of environment unfriendly materials such as plastic should be discouraged.

                  8. Instead of dumping domestic garbage in the pond, lake or river, these should be in a proper garbage areas.

                  9. A lot of environmental problems would disappear if we stop using petroleum, coal and natural gas as raw-materials for power generation. The focus should entirely shift on renewable sources of energy. The use of renewable sources of energy (example solar energy) would help saving the environment from global warming.
