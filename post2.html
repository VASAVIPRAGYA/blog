               <p> “I think this world is so beautiful that I can hardly believe it exists.”  The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner.     
                    “the simple perception of natural forms is a delight.” 
               </p> 
               <p></p>
               <p>
                  When we think of beauty in nature, we might most immediately think of things that dazzle the senses – the prominence of a mountain, the expanse of the sea, the unfolding of the life of a flower.  Often it is merely the perception of these things itself which gives us pleasure, and this emotional or affective response on our part seems to be crucial to our experience of beauty.  So in a way there is a correlate here to the intrinsic value of nature.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>
                 Most often, it seems to me, we find these things to be beautiful not because of something else they might bring us – a piece of furniture, say, or a ‘delicacy’ to be consumed – but because of the way that the forms of these things immediately strike us upon observation. In fact, one might even think that this experience of beauty is one of the bases for valuing nature – nature is valuable because it is beautiful.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>
                  In nature we observe growth and development in living things, contrasted with the static or deteriorating state of the vast majority of that which is man-made.  the relation between what we take to be an individual and the rest of nature as a quality of the beautiful.  This consists in the “power to suggest relation to the whole world, and so lift the object out of a pitiful individuality.”  In nature one doesn’t come across individuals that are robustly independent from their environment; rather things are intimately interconnected with their surroundings in ways that we don’t fully understand.
                  In nature we observe growth and development in living things, contrasted with the static or deteriorating state of the vast majority of that which is man-made.  the relation between what we take to be an individual and the rest of nature as a quality of the beautiful.  This consists in the “power to suggest relation to the whole world, and so lift the object out of a pitiful individuality.”  In nature one doesn’t come across individuals that are robustly independent from their environment; rather things are intimately interconnected with their surroundings in ways that we don’t fully understand.we can also experience the world as beautiful because of its rational structure and our ability to grasp that structure through thought. 
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>
                 There is thus an emotional or affective component in the beauty of the intellect just as there is in the immediate beauty of perception.  If we destroy the natural world, we take away the things that we can marvel at and experience awe towards in these two ways.  And this experience of the beautiful through the intellect may reinforce our attributing value to nature here as well, but a deeper kind of value, the intrinsic value I talked about in the last essay.  Here it is not only that nature is valuable because it is beautiful, but nature is beautiful because it possesses intrinsic value, grounded in its intelligible structure.  Thus we see a close parallel between goodness and beauty in nature.  We can find an objective basis for goodness and beauty in nature, namely its intelligible structure, but also see that nature is valuable and beautiful for us, with the particular apparatus that nature has given us for navigating our way through the world.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <P>
                 nature is the source of truth, goodness, and beauty, because of its intelligible structure, and because of its production of organisms that can recognize that structure, us.  And this view of nature includes an inherent call to protect that which is true, good, and beautiful.  These are the things that we as human beings are searching for, are striving after, and yet they’re right in front of us if only we would listen with our ear to the earth.
                 Although I’ve been advocating an approach to nature based on its intelligibility, we are far from tying down the giant that is nature with our minds."the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth."
               </P>
               <p></p>
               <p> "Nothing is quite beautiful alone , nothing but is beautiful in the whole. " </p>
               <p></p>

               <h3> So we should save the nature and environment  as : </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>1. Global warming is a serious environmental issue. The continuous emission of carbon dioxide by thermal power generating units is the leading cause for the surge in  greenhouse gases.

               2. Natural resources are limited. If the natural resources such as oil, coal, etc. are used, one day the world may fall short of these resources.<br>

               3. High-level of environmental pollution is detrimental for human and animal health.<br>

               4. Forests are fast depleting. It may cause soil erosion and drought situation.<br>

               5. Excessive use of pesticides and contamination of soil have negatively affected soil output. These fruits and vegetables are not very healthy for human health. 
               </p>  
               <p></p>   

               <h3>We can save the nature and environment by following these points :   </h3>

               <p></p> 

               <p>1. We should save drinking water. Water is a precious component of our environment. It should never be wasted.<br>

                  2. We should never pollute water. Efforts should be made in making significant reduction in both domestic and industrial disposal in water bodies.<br>

                  3. As far as practicable, the waste products should be recycled to make new items. The domestic and industrial garbage should be segregated as recyclable and non-recyclable before being dumped.<br>

                  4. There should be a zero tolerance policy towards deforestation. Each one of us can contribute towards saving the environment by planting just one tree every-month.<br>

                  5. We can make donations to NGOs that are engaged in planting trees, or in any-way working towards saving the environment.<br>

                  6. Safer environmental friendly car and vehicles should be used. For short distances, people should be encouraged to use bicycle in place of motor based vehicles.<br>

                  7. The use of environment unfriendly materials such as plastic should be discouraged.<br>

                  8. Instead of dumping domestic garbage in the pond, lake or river, these should be in a proper garbage areas.<br>

                  9. A lot of environmental problems would disappear if we stop using petroleum, coal and natural gas as raw-materials for power generation. The focus should entirely shift on renewable sources of energy. The use of renewable sources of energy (example solar energy) would help saving the environment from global warming. <br>
